# Project Introduction（项目介绍）
This is an alarm system where IoT devices issue warnings and then notify the responsible person via SMS or phone
这是一个警报系统，物联网设备发出警告，然后通过短信或电话通知负责人
# Open source reasons（开源原因）
I took on a private job worth 5000 yuan, trust acquaintances, and did not sign a contract. As a result, Party A made four changes to hardware requirements, three changes to page usage requirements, and one change to software mechanism requirements. In the end, I was nitpicking, saying that the Alibaba Cloud database I purchased, which is deployed on the internal network without developing external ports, may be attacked by hackers. I was asked to use code to implement a full system data backup. I can't stand that silly guy's demands. This contract has been terminated. But it's a pity to keep the code unused, and I have also gained some knowledge from the community, which has the idea of giving back to the community. The code for this project is currently open source. If you need it, you can take it yourself. The front-end and back-end are all included in this project.
Additionally, if you have any projects that require development, you can also contact me. I have the ability to develop and deploy projects on one line.

接了个5000块的私活，相信熟人，没有签合同。结果，甲方更改了四次硬件需求，三次页面使用需求，一次软件机制需求。最后还鸡蛋挑骨头，说购买的阿里云那部署在内网没有开发外网端口的数据库，有可能被黑客攻击，要求我再用代码实现一次全系统数据备份。我实在忍受不了那傻逼家伙的要求。解除了这个合同。但是代码留着不用有点可惜了，我也在社区获取了一些知识，有回报社区的想法。这个项目的代码现在开源，大家有需要的话自取，前端、后端、都在这个项目内。
另外，大家如果有项目需要开发，也可以联系我，我拥有一条线开发并部署项目的能力。
